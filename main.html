    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm. It describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the input size. Understanding time complexity helps developers create efficient algorithms that perform well under various conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space complexity measures the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. It is important for evaluating algorithms, especially when dealing with large data sets. For example, if an algorithm uses additional memory proportional to the input size, it can be described as having a space complexity of <b>O(n)</b>. 
        In this context, <b>Space Complexity</b> can significantly affect the performance of an application, particularly in memory-constrained environments.
