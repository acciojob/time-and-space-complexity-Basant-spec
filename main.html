        <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Space Complexity:</b> This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An efficient algorithm for many common operations has an average space complexity of <b>O(n)</b>.
